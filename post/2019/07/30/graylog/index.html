<p>Goto System Inputs
The input would be raw plaintext udp</p>

<h3 id="for-sending-logs-using-filebeat">For sending logs using filebeat</h3>

<p>sidecar config file is located at /etc/graylog/sidecar/sidecar.yml
add api key to connect sidecar to graylog server
server_api_token
The token can be generated from graylog on the users area</p>

<p>Download and install filebeat on the client machine</p>

<p><a href="https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-7.3.0-amd64.deb">https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-7.3.0-amd64.deb</a></p>

<p>The first step is to create a Beats input where collectors can send data to. Click on System / Inputs and start a global Beats input on the listening address 0.0.0.0 and port 5044.</p>

<p>Navigate to the Sidecars overview. In your Graylog web interface click on System / Sidecars.</p>

<p>Sidecar/Configuration</p>

<p>Next we create a new configuration: We give the configuration a name and select filebeat on Linux as collector. Most of the configuration defaults should work for you. However you need to change the hosts: setting and point it to your Beats input. You also might want to change the paths: to the location of your logs. When done click Create to save your configuration.</p>

<p>Next we need to assign our newly created configuration (and therefore the Filebeat collector) to our sidecar. Go to the Collector Administration page.</p>

<p>You will see a list of sidecars and underneath them a list of collectors that could be assigned to them. Please note that collectors are assigned to sidecars by means of applying a collector configuration to the sidecar. Therefore, we first select the filebeat collector and then click on the Configure menu, where we can select the filebeat-conf configuration we created earlier.</p>

<p>Confirming the assignment, will directly push this configuration to your sidecar which will go and start the Filebeat collector with this configuration.</p>

<p>If everything went fine, you should see the status running on the administration page.</p>

<p>You can go back to the Sidecars overview and click on the Show messages button to search for logs that have been collected via your sidecar.</p>
