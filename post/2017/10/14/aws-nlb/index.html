<p>A couple of my colleagues were fiddling around with NLB (Network Load Balancer) and couldn&rsquo;t find the instance name in target and only IP address of the instances was listed.
After some time not being able to find out we logged a support call with AWS and was directed to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html</a></p>

<h1 id="limits">Limits</h1>

<p>You cannot register instances by instance ID if they have the following instance types: C1, CC1, CC2, CG1, CG2, CR1, G1, G2, HI1, HS1, M1, M2, M3, and T1. You can register instances of these types by IP address.</p>

<p>We were using a M3 instance which seems to be the issue as it is not supported.</p>
